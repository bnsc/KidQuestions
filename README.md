# KidQuestions
Original Kid Questions app for iOS written in Objective C using XCode

This project was created as an attempt to learn Objective C.  The product is good and works, but deployment into the Apple App Store was a problem.  After several failed attempts, the project goals were changed, thus [the 2.0 version](https://github.com/bnsc/KidQuestions2.0) is written in jQuery for web deployment.
